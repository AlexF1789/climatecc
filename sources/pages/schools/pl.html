Group of our students participated in the Presidential Palace in the debate on the occasion of 10 - anniversary of Polish accession to the European Union. Young people interested in the subject of the EU, taking part in competitions organized by Polish MEPs, and as a reward - leaving for Brussels. Technical students over the years not only interested in issues related to their future profession, they also participate in the National Competition "Poland in NATO", Polish Olympic Games Knowledge of the European Union "Stardust Circle", Polish Olympic Games Knowledge of State and Law, occupying leading positions on the provincial stage, and even becoming winners. Young people from our school participated in the project "School of the Future in 2014."Turn on thinking" activity, which aims to prepare our teaching staff for use in the process of teaching the techniques of creative thinking, has been carried out. Our students many years occupy leading positions in the classification of sports high schools in Plock and in urban raids.Working on the international school project can help solve some problems with joining some students actively to school work, after school activities, to join their partners to school projects, to support students' communicative skills

					through the mobilities. Language knowledge of our students is very good, so they are keen on working on the common topics together with their partners from EU.
