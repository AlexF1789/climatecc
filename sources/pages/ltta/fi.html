				<h3 id="title">LTTA 3: Renewable Energies</h3>
				<p>It was organised in Lieksan Yläkoulu between 2023 February 6th - 10th.<br>The main subjects of the LTTA were climate change and the impacts of human action on it. Before LTTA, all the partner schools attended the meeting with their ready presentations which they prepared about renewable energy sources and the activists that students selected them as role models for themselves. The objectives of this LTTA were to create an understanding of the important role that renewable energy plays and will play in the future, and to encourage students to propose alternative energy strategies. Both host and visiting students gave presentations on the renewable energy challenges facing their countries. Teachers encouraged pupils to comment on the use of clean, renewable energy to reduce their impact on the environment and analysed each pupil's comment until they understood the positive and negative ways in which humans interact with ecosystems and how the benefits of using renewable energy sources could make a big difference. Mixed groups of pupils from each partner school brainstormed action plans to raise awareness of renewable energy sources, including personal sacrifice and commitment. Presentations about activists that students had chosen as role models were given by host and guest students. Students explained why they had chosen these people as role models. Mixed groups of students created posters with slogans or phrases they had come up with during the brainstorming session. The climate change posters were displayed in the Erasmus+ corner of the host school. 
					As an example of renewable energy sources, guest speakers from Green Fuel Nordic Oy, who produce bio-oil using forest biomass as a resource, presented their work. We also visited the city of Joensuu, where we were introduced to a learning environment at Riveria Vocational School.  We were shown an experimental zero-emission house that uses renewable energy sources. Press from Lieksa Lehti interviewed participants and a newspaper article was published. The planned event at the youth centre did not take place. The reason for this is that in a small town like Lieksa, the activities in the youth centre take place on weekends due to the lack of visitors during the week. Since LTTA takes place during the week, we had to give up the youth centre event. All participants attended the event organised as part of the project and the certification ceremony was held. Each group expressed their experiences and knowledge gained during the week. A coordinators' meeting was held to review and update the module and to evaluate the project process.</p>
