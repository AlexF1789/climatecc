				<h3 id="title">LTTA 6: Global Warming </h3>
				<p>It was organised at Gazi Anadolu Lisesi in Turkey on 20-24 November 2023.<br>All the activities were completed as planned in the application form. The main subjects of the LTTA were global warming and the impacts of human action on it. All the partner schools attended the meeting with their ready presentations which they had prepared about global warming. The objectives of the LTTA were to highlight the relation between global warming and climate change and to make students became more aware of impacts of human action on it, and also direct them to find out solutions by making lifestyle changes. Through the following activities, we could reach our desired objectives:
					Climate change club meeting was held. Both host and guest students presented their presentations that they had prepared about global warming issue with which their own countries face. After the presentations were presented, we directed students to discuss the presentations. We encouraged them to comment on especially those actions of each of us that have impacts on global warming by giving simple examples from real life. We analysed each of students’ comment until students realized the relation between global warming and climate change, and the effect of them on the world. We divided them into groups consisting students from each partner school and then we asked students what their action plans to tackle global warming, including personal sacrifice and commitment. Each group came up with different action plans. By unanimous vote, the 2nd group's idea of changing clothes was accepted to be implemented in all schools. In order to publicise the activity, students prepared a poster and this poster was used in all partner schools. Within the scope of the activity, students in all partner schools brought the clothes they did not wear. The collected clothes were exhibited on the announced date and distributed free of charge to students in need. With this activity, recycling awareness was created in students. All the groups visited Canik Nature and Science School in the region of the host school. The authorized persons gave information about the impacts of global warming on wildlife and students did activities about climate change. Brainstorming activity for global warming was done. Mixed groups of students created posters including catchy slogans about global warming. Coordinators meeting was held to review and update the Climate Change Challenge Module and evaluate the project process. The final version of the module was determined with mutual exchange of ideas. An event was organised at the host school to disseminate the project. The participants from partner schools, teachers and students from host school and parents of the host students and school board joined the event. During the week, all the guest students were hosted by the Turkish families which provided cultural exchange between students and help them get rid of bias towards different nations. A certification ceremony was organized and each group expressed their experiences and the knowledge that they obtained during the week.</p>
