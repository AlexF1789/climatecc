				<h3 id="title">LTTA 5: Deforestation</h3>
				<p>It was organised in Lisbon, Portugal between 2023 October 23rd - 27th<br>The main goal of this LTTA was to highlight the importance of tackling deforestation and also degradation that threaten the world, the important role that forests play in keeping the environment healthy and helping to address climate change through the capture of greenhouse gases and raise awareness about the ways that forests support human life, or the grave dangers many forests face.
					In order to do it, students researched about it, interviewed an activist, collected data and did their presentation about the topic in their country, besides they have done a presentation about one activist of their country.
					The participants in the activity could develop their soft skills, science literacy in the workshops and present their competitiveness and the ability to cooperate with others. They worked in mixed groups, which was an opportunity to present their sense of teamwork and mutual support. Having worked in international teams, they developed their communication skills in the English language.
					The activities benefited both students and teachers who can apply the methods used at the lessons in their countries. Furthermore, the activities gave the participants an opportunity to talk about their deforestation problems in their countries, to find similarities and differences.
					Apart from the major topic of the activity, the participants learnt about the Culture, History and lifestyle of Portugal. They visited the best-known sights and historical places in Lisbon guided by our students.
					In order to students understand the importance of Deforestation and Afforestation we took students to Espaço Monsanto which is integrated in the Forest Park (Portuguese: Parque Florestal de Monsanto) which was created in 1934, is a municipal protected forest in Lisbon, Portugal, is the largest green patch in the city, with almost 1000 ha (10 km2). Monsanto was arid and desert, after years of cereal exploitation that dried up the approximately one thousand hectares that now have more life and biodiversity. Is management by the City Hall of Lisboa, by a division of parks of Lisboa (Municipality), in order to understand the policy that Lisboa Municipality has about these questions. It was possible for students and teachers to contribute to afforestation and planting trees. Eng. Fernando Louro Alves conducted a workshop, Monsanto in Focus-Planting the Future.
					The school arranged a conference in cooperation with a NG organization ZERO – Association, the title was The forest in Portugal: Challenges for the future with José Paulo Martins Member of General Council and Project Office. The activity was focused on the characteristics of flora and problems of Deforestation in Portugal.
					The presentations made by students at their schools about deforestation and degradation were presented. Students discussed and commented on why deforestation is a threat to the world and the effect of human action on deforestation and degradation.  
					The leading school invited two experts to conduct a Workshop - WILDFIRES – a burning issue Joana Terra da Motta, Ph.D of IADE Creative University and Carmo Leal from European University.  This workshop led to a discussion about the issues addressed. Students were asked to create a poster about Clean-up-day, in which they were asked not to use any digital equipment, only manual skills, like Drawing and Painting.
					The activity offered an opportunity to work and cooperate in international groups so that the participants could develop their interpersonal and communication skills. Working in teams, supporting and helping each other enabled them to learn about their abilities and skill, which may strengthen their confidence in further work.
					They organized a communication campaign by creating posters with the aim of raising awareness in their schools. This campaign was done in Canvas. The activity also focused on developing the essential soft skills. Debates and discussing the topic of the project supported the participants´ communication skills in the foreign language as well as problem-solving skills having answered the question „Climate Changes Challenge“. The activities also offered the opportunity to improve participants´ critical thinking – analysing, reasoning, judging and understanding the Climate issue.
					The participants visited the Park and Pena Palace. It was chosen because the Park and National Palace of Pena is integrated in the "European Route of Historic Gardens", within the “Cultural Routes of the Council of Europe'' since 2020, also are UNESCO patrimony known for its diverse and lush flora: Cork Oak (Quercus suber); corky bark; Pine Trees; Eucalyptus Trees; Laurel Forest; Azaleas and Rhododendrons; Camellias; Ferns; Mediterranean Scrub; Exotic Ornamental Plants; Mosses and Lichens. This visit was guided by a Senior Biology Technician at the Park Educational Services.
					The Cultural Landscape of Sintra is located in Portugal’s central region, at the extreme west of the Iberian Peninsula and a few kilometres away from the Atlantic Ocean. This Cultural Landscape is an exceptional mixture of natural and cultural sites within a distinct framework. Seen from a distance, it gives the impression of an essentially natural landscape that is distinct from its surroundings: a small chain of forested granite mountains rising over the hilly rural landscape. When seen from closer at hand, the Serra reveals surprisingly rich cultural evidence spanning over several centuries of Portugal's history.
					Around 1840, King Ferdinand II turned a ruined monastery into a castle in which Gothic, Egyptian, Moorish and Renaissance elements were displayed. He surrounded the palace with a vast Romantic park, unparalleled elsewhere planted with rare and exotic trees, decorated with fountains, watercourses and series of ponds, cottages, chapels and mock ruins, and traversed by magical paths. He also restored the forests of the Serra, where thousands of trees were planted to supplement the oaks and umbrella pines which made a perfect contribution to the romantic character of the Cultural Landscape of Sintra
					The certification ceremony was held as is normal in all mobilities since it is part of the project. A meeting of coordinators took place where it was possible to discuss the progress of the project.</p>
