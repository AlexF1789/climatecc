				<h3 id="title">LTTA 4: Combating Climate Change</h3>
				<p>It was organised in Płock, Poland between 2023 May 22nd - 26th.<br>The main subjects of the LTTA are climate change and the impacts of human action on it. Before LTTA, all the partner schools attended the meeting with their ready presentations which they prepared about the reasons for climate change and the activists that students  selected as role models for themselves. The goal of this LTTA was to make students become more conscious about the impacts of human action on climate change and internalise that everything they did to protect the environment  responded positively at local, national and international levels. In addition, we aimed to enable them to show the desired changes in their daily lives which will last lifelong in order to reduce the effects of climate change.
					During official Opening Ceremony partners were presented and welcomed by the authority of the school.  Each group presented themselves and their project teams. Climate change club meeting was held. Both host and guest students presented their presentations about climate change issue that their own country faced. They also informed the other partners about the activities that they had done before the LTTA. We divided students into groups consisting of students from each partner school and then we  asked students what their action plans to tackle climate change were including personal sacrifice and commitment.
					The presentations about activists that students  accepted as role models for themselves were presented by host and guest students. Students  explained why they had selected these individuals as role models and also we let students ask about whatever they wonder about the activists that their friends presented. Afterwards, host and guest students exchanged ideas about a common campaign for climate change to be realised at their own school under the name of climate change club after this LTTA. The outlines of the club activity were determined.
					Ecological workshop was organised by professional activist from Ecofarm.Ecological workshops was a set of activities aimed at shaping young people's social awareness and developing entrepreneurial attitudes focused on ecology, developing creativity and basic social values in children and consolidating positive pro-ecological and pro-social behaviours.Students were be divided into groups consisting of students from each partner school. Brainstorming activity for climate change was done. Afterwards, each group of students created a poster including slogans or phrases that they’ve created during the brainstorming session. A competition was held. Students voted to select the best poster.Host school organised a meeting with the president of our city.Partners could talk about problems of climate change in the area of Płock.
					Partners visited one of the biggest oil refineries in Europe-Orlen.Environmental protection is one of the key elements of this company's responsibility. The main goals that are implemented under this pillar are to minimise the impact on the natural environment: protection of biodiversity, sustainable water and sewage management, minimising pollution and circular economy.The ORLEN Group responds to the risk of climate change and the new operating model of the energy sector by installing chargers for electric cars at passenger service points, preparing passenger service areas for new needs related to e-mobility, investing in bio-refineries, testing innovative biofuel production technologies and preparing for taking a strategic position in the production and use of hydrogen in transport and energy.
					 Cultural visits were organised by the host partners. We visited Warsaw with a professional guide,partners saw the most important places in our capital and spent time in Interactive Science Museum Copernicus.They could experience some aspects of climate change-earthquake, hurricanes,strong weather conditions.They visited Płock with its cultural attractions from 12 century.Ecology lessons were held on the topic Climate Change.Coordinators meeting was held to review and update the module and evaluate the project process. Host and guest students gave information about the project and the activities done at their schools, informed all the groups about the details and the tasks of the students' activities.  Each group expressed their experiences and the knowledge that they obtained during the week, and then a certification ceremony was organised.</p>
