				<h3 id="title">Project objectives</h3>
				<p>Our project aims to effectively address climate change in partner schools through active learning as part of the extracurricular curriculum. Additionally, we aim to inspire and guide other schools through the climate change education module that we have created, improve the ICT skills of teachers and students, and reduce absenteeism and early school leaving rates at partner schools. Our priorities have been chosen based on these reasons. 
					Climate change is not only a scientific phenomenon but also a socio-scientific issue.  Therefore, teaching students about the science behind climate change is not sufficient. Based on the data obtained from environmental education research, project-based learning is identified as one of the most effective methods to stimulate students' curiosity and develop their motivation towards environmental issues. It is important for students to learn how to combat climate change both individually and as a society. Schools have a responsibility to teach global citizenship and community stewardship. Therefore, they should teach about climate change and organize activities that encourage school communities to make beneficial lifestyle changes to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by human behaviour. According to an article published by the World Bank, it is essential to cultivate values and knowledge among young people so that they can lead more sustainable lives. Appropriate teaching programmes must be promoted to stimulate curiosity about the natural world and concern for the health of the planet. In addition, UNESCO's Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) includes climate change. Our project has been designed to be environmentally friendly, with activities and products planned to minimize harm to the environment. We have aimed to minimize waste by digitizing and using minimal school supplies. Additionally, to disseminate project results more widely and ensure their long-term availability online, all project outcomes have been created using web-based tools.
					The COVID-19 pandemic has made it essential for schools to undergo digital transformation in order to provide basic education to the younger generation. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the digital skills of both teachers and students. To achieve desirable outcomes, it is important to ensure that students remain engaged in the education process. Reducing rates of early school leaving and absenteeism are primary targets in the school policies of all partner schools.
					 Reducing absenteeism and early school leaving rates is a key issue in the strategic framework of European Cooperation for Education and Training. Creating an inclusive school environment and a school community that values diversity are among the most effective methods to achieve this goal.</p>
